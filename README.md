# StudentsAndUniversities
This was my last term project for CSC222 at NVCC. The assignment was to write a CSV parser for a list of students and a list of universities. We then needed to write 
these objects to binary files, and finally tabulate all of the data and pretty print a formatted report as a text file.

The design document, like all of them this semester, was full of vague statements and contradictions, so this is just my best attempt at writing a logical program.
The assignment said it was going to include a testdriver class to test our implementations as well as two formatting modules to help with the text output, 
however neither of them were included. So all of the code was written by me according to the examples the specification gave. The SandUFileFormats.txt, 
StudentFile.txt, and Universities9.txt files were given as an example/input files, everything else was written by me or generated by the program. The parser
reads from the StudentFile.txt and Universities9.txt files, and then outputs to the binaries and the UniversityReport.txt file.
